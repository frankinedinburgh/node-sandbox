The only notifications that return a type is "chat"



"Your blog has not been approved."

"A creator you follow has a new video/blog."

"A channel you subscribe to has a new video."

"Someone has commented on your video."

"Your video has been approved."

"Someone has replied to your comment."

"A show you follow has a new video."


All notifications apart from chat return a response using the below schema.
